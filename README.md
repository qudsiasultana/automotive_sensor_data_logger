# Automotive Sensor Data Logger

## Project Overview
A hardware and software solution to log data from automotive sensors, which can help in diagnosing vehicle performance issues.

## Components Needed
#### Hardware:
1. Arduino Uno: The microcontroller used to interface with sensors and handle data logging.
2. DHT11 Temperature Sensor: To measure ambient temperature.
3. ADXL345 Accelerometer: To measure acceleration in three axes.
4. SD Card Module: To store the logged data.
5. Connecting Wires and Breadboard: For setting up the circuit.

#### Software:
1. Arduino IDE: For writing and uploading the code to the Arduino.
2. Libraries: Utilized libraries like SPI, SD, Wire, Adafruit_Sensor, Adafruit_ADXL345_U, and DHT for sensor interfacing and SD card communication.
